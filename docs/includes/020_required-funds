<h1 id="required-funds">Required Funds</h1>

<p>Calling Smart Contracts requires funds: &ldquo;It is the fuel that allows it to operate&rdquo;. <a href="https://bws.ninja">Blockchain Web Services</a> uses Auto Trading to buy - real time - the required Tokens you need. Just fund your account and we convert your USD credits to the required network currency.</p>

<h2 id="auto-trading">Auto Trading</h2>

<p>Everytime you call a BWS Solution smart contract, we verify you have enough network tokens and Order some if your token balance is low (for example, we buy <code class="prettyprint">ETH</code> if you decide to use Ethereum network, or we buy <code class="prettyprint">MATIC</code> if you use Polygon).</p>

<p>To check all your exchange orders go to <code class="prettyprint">My Account &gt; Auto Trading</code> and select <code class="prettyprint">Token Order</code> list.</p>

<p>Please note that to execute Smart Contracts we also need to withdrawal your token funds to the appropiate network account. You can check those withdrawals by selecting the <code class="prettyprint">Withdrawal</code> list.</p>
