# Required Funds

Calling Smart Contracts requires funds: "It is the fuel that allows it to operate". [Blockchain Web Services](https://www.bws.ninja) uses Auto Trading to buy - real time - the required Tokens you need. Just fund your account and we convert your USD credits to the required network currency.

## Auto Trading

Everytime you call a BWS Solution smart contract, we verify you have enough network tokens and Order some if your token balance is low (for example, we buy `ETH` if you decide to use Ethereum network, or we buy `MATIC` if you use Polygon).

To check all your exchange orders go to `My Account > Auto Trading` and select `Token Order` list.

Please note that to execute Smart Contracts we also need to withdrawal your token funds to the appropiate network account. You can check those withdrawals by selecting the `Withdrawal` list.
